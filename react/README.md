# React + Vite + Material UI + Electron

This project is a desktop app built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Material UI, and Electron. It will replicate the orb management, soundboard, and canvas features from the original web project, but with a modern component-based architecture and desktop packaging.

## Features
- Orb Admin (add, edit, remove orbs)
- Soundboard (add, trigger, remove sounds)
- Animated Canvas (405x720, orb visuals)
- Material UI theming
- Electron desktop support

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. (Coming soon) Start Electron:
   ```sh
   npm run electron
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/` — React components and app logic
